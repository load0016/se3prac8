Introduction
------------
For this practical, I have joined with Jayden Roberts and Jarred Daw to create a group of three. We have been friends since first year of University. Considering that we have been pair programming since first year, we knew the limitations of each other and therefore, knew how to delegate tasks to each other. The three of us have learnt Java Programming through the course of our degrees and therefore, have based this exercise on that particular language.

Advantages
----------
The main advantages of pair programming for us was the ability to delegate modules of code to each other. Each of us would assign a certain part of the program depending on the skills needed for each section. The hardest part would be assigned to the group member with the high coding skills. If either of us were to have problems coding our assigned parts, we could easily ask each other for help which I found to be incredibly helpful as someone might know something more than myself or another group member.

I found that tasks were completed at a faster rate as the delegating would give us each a section to do in isolation which would be overviewed at the end. Once our sections were complete, we would come together to ensure the program is performing to the expectations of our group. I found that each of us had a different style to the way we code therefore, rather than asking who's code is more correct, it's better to ask which method implemented would deliver the final result to create a better program.

Disadvantages
-------------
I found we didn't have many difficulties as a group, instead I believe we each have our issues using any programming language. Considering we have only been programming with Java since first year of University as a group, I believe the only thing that needs improvements is our abilities to program. If each of us were to improve with programming, I believe a greater program will be created in the end.

Conclusion
----------
I believe we work well together as a group as it gives us the opportunity to throw ideas off each other at anytime when we encounter problems in our delegated areas. I believe the whole experience worked well as each of us lack the expert knowledge in the programming field as a whole and working together gives us the opportunity to learn off each others mistakes which will allow us to become better programmers.

I don't believe I would change anything about the way we work together. Over the course of our degrees we have been pair programming since day one and because of that, we have created a certain method which allows us to program in comfort because we can always rely on each other to get the job done. I believe the only area that needs change is our knowledge in the Java Programming language.

Would I use pair programming in the future given the chance? I believe I would, I have experience both coding by myself and in many groups and I believe the better outcome has always been in a group. When I code by myself, I need to search for resources to answer all my problems but when I'm in a group, I can always throw ideas off someone else and problems will always be answered.
