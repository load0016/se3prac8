Introduction
------------
For this practical, I have joined with Jayden Roberts and Jarred Daw to create a group of three. We have been friends since first year of University. Considering that we have been pair programming since first year, we knew the limitations of each other and therefore, knew how to delegate tasks to each other. The three of us have learnt Java Programming through the course of our degrees and therefore, have based this exercise on that particular language.
